# Mundys 2023 Challenge
I'm excited to share that my team and I won the competition sponsored by Mundys as part of the *StartITALIA* project. The competition marked the end of a training program in the entrepreneurial and startup industries put on by JE Italy - Junior Enterprises Italy and Orizzonte Italia with the support of the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri.

The challenge's objective was to come up with creative approaches to bring GenZ closer to the Mundys holding. Our approach is based on two pillars: revolutionizing the way the company communicates with potential candidates and enhancing the job candidate experience. The central foundation of our proposal is a platform that seamlessly integrates technologies such as artificial intelligence and gamification to facilitate an immersive corporate experience for candidates. The prototype we were able to build showcases how our platform can use AI to match candidates with the best career opportunities at Mundys based on their skills, experience, and preferences. Additionally, we incorporated gamification elements to engage users and make the hiring process more interactive and fun. Our efforts were recognized by the jury, which included managers and C-level executives from companies such as Accenture, Mundys, BTO Research, and Startup Geeks.

## Prototype Features
- AI chat-based interaction that matches candidate interests with available spots in the company.
